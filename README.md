# bashfi
Bash script for wifi pentesting/hacking, make sure you have a wireless adaptor that supports monitor mode and packet injection. The script won't work properly without one.

1. git clone https://github.com/Sud03GDE/bashfi
2. sudo apt install figlet macchanger aircrack-ng reaver bully wifite net-tools wireless-tools
3. pip install termdown (for the countdown timer)
4. cd bashfi
5. chmod +x bashfi2.sh
6. ./bashfi2.sh
7. Enjoy the script! This took roughly 6 months to code in all. Main reason it took so long was researching the attacks and code required for the script. Leave a comment in the issuses tab if I missed a certain package(s) or you're encountering a syntax error.
